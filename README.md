# Consistent Hashing

consistent hashing is a special kind of hashing technique such that when a hash table is resized, only n/m keys need to be remapped on average where n is the number of keys and m is the number of slots

### use cases
   - Horizontal Scalability
   - Load Balancing
   - Data Distribution

In this demo I demonstrated how **Load balancing** works
